Devil Spirit: Warrior… forget not thy path. The spirits that bar thy way cannot be struck down by steel, but by the game of Blackjack.
Jaeger: Yes… I recall thy command. Yet why cards, and not battle?
Devil Spirit: Their strength is bound to fate, to number and chance. Each victory thou claimest shall sap their power. But shouldst thou falter, the loss shall be thine—thy life weakened, thy soul diminished
Jaeger: So every match is a trial—one that breaks them… or breaks me.
Devil Spirit: Just so. Defeat them, one by one, and their dominion shall crumble. Fail, and thou shalt wither before their grasp.”
Jaeger: Then I will not falter. I will face them all, until none remain.
Devil Spirit: Good… Remember, mortal—thy battlefield is the table, and thy fate lies in the turn of the card.
