Ashkarot the Soul Demon: Warrior… forget not thy path. The spirits that bar thy way cannot be struck down by steel, but by the game of Blackjack.
Jaeger: Yes… I recall thy command. Yet why cards, and not battle?
Ashkarot the Soul Demon: Their strength is bound to fate, to number and chance. Each victory thou claimest shall sap their power. But shouldst thou falter, the loss shall be thine—thy life weakened, thy soul diminished
Jaeger: So every match is a trial—one that breaks them… or breaks me.
Ashkarot the Soul Demon: Just so. Defeat them, one by one, and their dominion shall crumble. Fail, and thou shalt wither before their grasp.”
Jaeger: Then I will not falter. I will face them all, until none remain.
Ashkarot the Soul Demon: Good… Remember, mortal—thy battlefield is the table, and thy fate lies in the turn of the card.
